 1. [Supervised Learning](https://github.com/avelicha/Supervised_Learning_DSND_CharityML/blob/master/finding_donors_charityml.ipynb):
    Developed a machine learning model to best identify potential donors for a fictitious charity organization and reduce overhead cost of sending mail. 
    Evaluated and optimized several different supervised learners to determine which algorithm will provide the highest donation yield while also reducing the total number of letters being sent.
 2. [Deep Learning](https://github.com/avelicha/Deep_Learning_DSND_Image_Classifier/blob/master/image_classifier_git.ipynb): Developed an Image Classifier 
    with PyTorch that can recognize different species of flowers.
 3. [Unsupervised Learning](https://github.com/avelicha/Unsupervised_Learning_DSND_Identify_Customer_Segments/blob/master/identify_customer_segments_git.ipynb): 
    Worked with real-life data provided by Udacity's Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Finance Solution. My job as a data scientist was to use unsupervised learning techniques to organize the general population into clusters, then use those clusters to see which of them comprise the main user base for the company.
